            <h2>Wien-Bridge Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    S basic RC oscillator that doesn't require a external input to oscillate. Instead, the oscillation occurs due to a mix a positive and negative feedback in the circuit.

                                The circuit is powered by a 9v so a bias of 4.5v is created with a voltage divider and a buffer so the oscillation would be centered at 4.5v. For simulation purposes I also added a sine wave to add noise to the 9V power supply to see how it would impact the bias voltage.

                                Wien-Bridge consists of two RC networks, one in parallel and one in series. The values of both the resistor and capacitors in each RC network are the same(are very similar considereing tolerances). This allows the two RC networks to have the same Resonant Frequency (Equation = 1/(2*pi*R*C)) forming a bandpass filter with one resonant frequency. The diodes are used as a way
                                to apply a controlled compression to the amplifier output.

                                after the output of the wienbridge the signal is then goes through a inverting amplifier so I can adjust the amplitude of the signal. Note that This simulation is using a gain of 1 as a place holder the actual values would be 10k for input resistance and 100 in series with a 10k potentiometer in the feeback resistance. The choice to go with an inverting amplifer came from the idea that the output of the signal is round 2v peak-to-peak and I would like for the ability to decrease the signal to a smaller amplitude which was possible if I went with a 
                                inverting amplifier topology rather than a non-inverting topology.

                                Power comes from a 9v source and in the simulation a siganl with 1v peak-to-peak (was too lazy to change it to something more similar to real noise) was added in series with the 9v to simulate some noise. the use of a decoupling capacitor in the voltage divider was used to reject the noise that comes from the simulated noise. the draw back can be seen in the picture below. The voltage takes time to center it itself to 4.5v as the capacitor prevents the voltage from rising too fast . Decreasing the capacitor value would allow for the bias voltage to rise to 4.5v faster but at the cost of less of the noise being rejected.

                                circuit simulation gives an output signal of 1.27v amplitude with a frequency of 14.39Kh when resistor value is 100 ohms and capacitor is 100 nF. When computing the resonant frequency of the circuit the value comes out to be 15.91 Khz (1/(2*pi *100 *100*10^9)). Which gives about a 10% difference from the the simulated value from the calculated value .

                            board was a 2 layer board with a top layer as the signal layer and the second layer a ground plane. The top plane would also contain a ground copper field and be connected to the second layer with via stiching. 2.54mm pin headers were used for the potentiometers, power input,and output of the circuit. pinheaders weren't actually planned it just that that form factor allow external wires to be soldered easily. Due to concern for the need to debug (mistakes happen) i opted to use 0603 smd components and 8 dip for the op amps that way I need to improvise some connections I can do so easier with these bigger parts. the PCB would 
                            have 2 potentiometers one that connected in series of the feedback resistor for the inverting amplifer so I could have a variable gain and the second would be a dual potentiometer that is connect to the two resitors in the RC networks.
