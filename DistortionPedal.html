            <div class="paragraph">
                The project was for a simple distortion pedal powered by a 9 volt barrel jack and would be used as part of a signal chain for an electric guitar. The distortion pedal would connect to the output of the guitar, distort the signal, and then output that distored signal to the next 
                part of the signal chain or into a amplifier. The pedal would also contain 3 different potentionmeters used alter the circuits gain, frequency response, and output signal amplitude.

                <h2> Simulation</h2>
                    <img src ="images/DIST_Sim_circuit.PNG" class ="center" width="75%" height = "50%">
                    <p>
                        To begin the design I decided to simulate the circuit to get a rough idea of how the circuit will behave and provide me with insight on how the circuit should behave so in the even that the circuit needs to be debugged have values from the simulation that I can use to check/debug the circuit with.
                    </p>
                    <h3>power</h3>
                        <p>
                            for simulations purpose I used a 9 DC supply with com decoupling capacitors and voltage divder resistors to split the voltage in half. The actual circuit would incorporate an op amp buffer for the voltage divider mostly because I have an extra op amp but also to prevent changes in resistance that would change how the voltage divder behaved.
                        </p>
                    <h3>non-inverting op-amp</h3>
                        <img src ="images/DIST_opamp.PNG" class ="center" width ="50%" height="50%">
                        <p>
                            the distortion pedal utilizes a non-inverting topology with a variable gain as the potentiometer is connected in series with the feedback loop. This particular simulation would have a gain range from 2 - 4 (equation is 1 + R2/R1). There is also a coupling capacitor both in the input and output of the op amp to remove DC offsets going in and out of the op amp.

                    <h3>clipping diode and volume control</h3>
                        <img src="images/DIST_clipping_and_volume_sim.PNG" class="center" width="75%" height="50%">
                        <p>
                            The diodes are arranged at the output of the op-amp and are used to clip the signal after thee signal is amplified. This particular pair of diodes is known as "hard clipping" diodes. A soft clipping version would see the diodes in the feeback system of the op-amp. The choice of diodes is practically just tast as different diodes would contain differt forward voltages and clip the signal differently becuase of that. This particular circuit uses the 1n4148 diodes are they are 
                            fairly common diode to find. This part of the schematic also contains a low pass filter and a voltage divider. The Lowpass filter has a resistor in series with a potentiometer so that the cutoff freqeuncy can be chagned. This is known as the tone control and basically alters the frequency response of the circuit as it either cuts out frequenicies are allow more frequencies. The voltage divider is also just a potentiometer set up as a voltage divider to further alter the "volume" of the 
                            circuit. One difference to note between the potentiometer that changes gain vs the potentiometer that alters volume is that the gain is set up so at the top of the gain range you can slightly saturate the op signal as well as chaging the peak-to-peak of the signal can influence how much of the signal is clipped by the diodes. Whereas the volume potentiometer is just changing the peak-to-peak of the output signal.

                    <h2>KiCad circuit</h2>
                        <p>
                            <img src = "images/DIST_OPAMP_Bias.PNG" class = "center" width=" 50%" height=" 50%">
                            since the circuit is powered by a 9v source I use an opamp to buffer the voltage source and create a 4.5v bias that I can use for the input of the distortion pedal to center the audio signal in the middle of 9v range decoupling capacitors are used to remove noise. the use of an op amp isn't necessary but I choose to use it as I wanted to use a 8 dip op amp  which typically contains two different op amps. In addition the use of a voltage divider to spit the voltage can isn't the most secure way to obtain 4.5v as resistance changes could potentially change the output voltage. The use of the op amp act as a buffer so the 4.5 voltage is isolated from any potential resistance changes when connecting 4.5v to another system
                            the KiCad circuit follows the general circuit schematic from the LTSpice schematic rather closley with the only key difference being the power goes through a buffer
                        </p>       
                    <h2>Simulation</h2>  
                        <img src="images/DIST_clean_and_amplified.PNG" class="center" width="75%" height="50%">
                        <p>
                            the blue signal is output of the opamp and the red is the original signal that has a dc offset of 4.5v the simulation was done with a gain of around 2
                        </p>   
                        <img src="images/DIST_SIM_CleanVsDIsT.PNG"  class="center" width="75%" height="50%" >                  
                        <p>
                            the blue signal is the orignal signal and the green is the distorted signal. One thing to note is that the distorted signal is acutally smaller than the original signal which is expected just because the clipping diodes activate at a certain point and leads a path to ground for the signal.
                            This is also fine because this circuit isn't supposed to amplify the circuit it the only reason why the circuit amplifies the signal is because it allows the signal to be large enough to be modified by circuit like with the clipping diodes.

                        <i>distorted signal FFT</i>    
                        <p>
                            The first picture is the FFT response of the clean signal and the second is the FFT response of the distorted signal.As the signal goes through the circuit the distortion brings out some of the harmonics and makes the harmonics of the signal more prominent. Whereas with the orignal signal, most of the harmonis are hidden in the noise in the signal. From the FFT simulations, it also seems that the circuit also seems to have cleaned up the signals which is more than likely attributed to the low pass filter at the ends of the circuit.

                    <p>
                        there isn't much to talk about the PCB but one thing to note is that I did use 2.54mm pinheaders for many of the potentiomters and the input and output of the circuits. The reason for this is the potentiometers,power, and ouput of the circuit are all mounted on a enclosure so i can use these headers and wire to connect the circuit to these external components.
